# Point Transformer based Auto-Encoder for Robot Grasping and Quality Inference

This code is the implementation of a project that I have worked on for the [Barton Research Group](https://brg.engin.umich.edu/research/robotic-smart-manufacturing).
In this project we studied how transformer blocks that are set operators are particularly well suited for point clouds and thus make auto-encoders very efficient on point clouds, conserving their permutation invariance and study the application of such algorithms on an application for Robot Grasping.
